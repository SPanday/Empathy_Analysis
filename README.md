## Problem Statement
### You are working for a non-profit that is recruiting student volunteers to help with Alzheimerâ€™s patients. You have been tasked with predicting how suitable a person is for this task by predicting how empathetic he or she is.

There are three python files involved:
1. FinalClassifier.py (Main file with the final version of the voting classifier that will be used for the testing data)
2. BasicTries.py (File with general functions used by FinalClassifier.py as well as all the baseline classifiers tried)
3. ParameterTuning.py (Useful for paramater tuning using grid search techniques)

Also, has four saved files for faster output:
1. bestDCT.pkl
2. bestSVC.pkl
3. bestRFC.pkl
4. ensemble.sav

Please make sure the following packages are already instlled:
  pandas 
  numpy 
  sklearn   
  warnings
  pickle

Steps for running:

Run *FinalClassifier.py* to see the final accuracies for validation and testing set using final as well as baseline classifiers.
